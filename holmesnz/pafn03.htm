<blockquote><p>Notes from Terry Moulin, 2002:<br>
In 1899 his address was Linwood.<br>
Had an Orangeman's sash.<br>
Was a dairyman in 1905.<br>
Caretaker of Sydenham Park, Christchurch for over 30 years including 1913-15 (Wise's Directory).<br>
Was 10 years old when his Dad died.<br>
Lived in Chch City Council house.</p>
<p>Biography by Pat Percival:<br>
My grandfather was caretaker of Sydenham Park for 30 years. All the family attended Sydenham school.<br>
My mother Mona &amp; her youngest sister Ray attended Chch Girls' High, the younger boys attended Chch Boys' High.<br>
The eldest son Joe was a baker and his nickname was "Doughy" Holmes.
Nancy was a school teacher, as was Tom. Ray worked at the stocking box
in Colombo St, Mona worked in the office at Adams Ltd. Graham was a
welder and taught night school at Tech.<br>
Rene &amp; Ray played hockey, Mona basketball and the boys rugby.<br>
After my grandfather retired he came to live with us at Bamford St (he
&amp; Grandma had separated) and she lived at Cashmere with Ray and
died suddenly in her fifties.<br>
I remember him with great affection, he always had a penny or
threepence on his dresser for me! and always said I was the best girl
he'd seen that day. It was until later I realized I was the only one he
had seen!<br>
I was 12 when he passed away, he was cremated and his ashes were scattered over Sydenham Park.</p>
<p>Notes from Fay Gray, 2014:<br>
I can just remember him at Mona's place in Bamford Street in bed. Must
have been just before he died. Think we went to visit him by bus as we
did not have a car. I have been told that he and Dad (Graham) took all
the pine trees for the Burwood Plantation in Christchurch to the area
by horse and dray from Sydenham.</p>

<blockquote><p>Notes from Fay Gray, 2014:<br>
Was Deans Scholar (dux) of Christchurch Boys' High School and his cap
and certificate together with old style records on the teaching of
French were given back to the school on his death by Dad. He also
played cricket for CBHS and there are photos of him on the school
walls. He was assistant principal of Wellington College for a number of
years and before coming to Christchurch with Kathleen and Rex when they
retired, he lived with them in Lower Hutt. He was very interested in
classical music and I have a number of very old records with various
classical operas and speeches by Prime Ministers etc. We kept in touch
with Thomas, Rex &amp; Kathleen when they shifted to Christchurch and
they helped finance the purchase of a car for Dad and Mum who would
take them out for drives to various picnic spots at weekends. Thomas
never married.</p></blockquote>

<p>23. <a href="pafg03.htm#40" name="40"><b>Graham Jack HOLMES</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Notes from Fay Gray, 2014:<br>
He played hockey and I have been told that he was the first male to
umpire womens hockey in NZ but as yet I have not been able to confirm
this. During the war he was in the Home Guard. He applied to the army
but was not accepted because he had "flat feet". When Dad left school
he took up work in the office of a Warehouse company but found this did
not suit him. He left and went panel beating at Parks' garage in
Christchurch and did this for a number of years. He then left and
worked for Andrews and Beavan in their metal workshop for quite some
time and was the first person to use a profile cutting machine. He cut
all the steel for the bridge over the Clutha River in Alexandra and
also the steel for what was the railway station then Science alive in
Moorhouse Avenue in Christchurch. Now gone because of the earthquakes
and the brickwork failing. He taught welding at Christchurch Technical
College (now CPIT). He also had a contract to repair all the wire milk
crates for the Christchurch area and did this from his garage at home
at night and weekends. It was my job to hammer all the pieces of 8
gauge wire straight so he could weld them into place. He also drove a
taxi for a while. He was Secretary of the Canterbury branch of the New
Zealand Institute of Welding for a number of years and from letters I
have on file he was well thought of at the time of his resignation. In
his latter years he gave up welding and worked as a Verger at
Christchurch Cathedral. I have a number of books etc that were given to
tourists and they tell a very interesting story about the building of
the Cathedral and on reading it reconstruction should not take place.
He died after having Motor Neurone disease for three years.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Notes from Nick Holmes, 2013:<br>
According to the records was just one year old when his dad (William)
died accidentally. He would have been raised by his step-father, Robert
Watson.<br>
His grandson Richard Holmes has a memory of 'Grandpop' coming to watch him play soccer when he was around 10 years old.</p>

<blockquote><p>Notes from Nick Holmes, 2013:<br>
Sadly is not fondly remembered by her grandchildren, and the reputation
is perpetuated. Late 2012 it was discovered that she had been one of
ten children. It was again suggested by her granddaughters that one
would have thought she might have had a more generous nature, having
grown up with that many siblings.</p>

<p>27. <a href="pafg03.htm#1" name="1"><b>Gordon Thomas HOLMES</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Notes from Nick Holmes, 2013:<br>
It is rumoured he was disinherited for marrying a Catholic. This is
unconfirmed. His children had a lot more to do with their mother’s
side, the Burkes (she was the eldest of nine children). He did not go
to war, which was never forgotten by his brothers-in-laws, although
they themselves suffered long-lasting effects. He worked for the Public
Trust and also was a secretary of the National Party. He gets a mention
in the book that was written about the first 50 years of the party. He
attended Christchurch Boys’ High, which enabled some of his
grandchildren to attend in recent years. He and his wife Eileen also
ran a milk bar at one point. They were frugal, having seven children,
but being an office worker he did things like buy life insurance
policies for each of his children when they were born. He was also
known in later years to cook breakfast on a Saturday morning for
whomever was still left living at home. Dad tells a story about a time
when all the kids were conscripted to help paint the roof, and his Dad
saying, "Don't be afraid to <span style="font-style: italic;">put some on</span>."</p></blockquote>
