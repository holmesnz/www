<p><a href="pafg02.htm#9" name="9"><b>Sarah Maria ORR</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Notes from Terry Moulin, 2002:<br>
Sarah was 25 yrs old when she emigrated on the "Mary Shephered" on 20 Aug 1873. with Andrew 3, Mary 1.<br>
She had boys later to William, and was rumoured to have had 2 girls
(Sadie &amp; Queenie) to Robert Watson (her granddaughter (Joseph's
youngest daughter Ray) said she remembered Queenie and that she had a
"lazy eye").<br>
However, her children refute this when contesting her estate in the
Supreme court. It has since been shown that Sadie and "Quiny" were
Sarah's granddaughters via Mary Jane (HOLMES) HANSON.<br>
Lived in Halswell, Christchurch in 1886.</p><p>Update 2015: Newspaper article found (Christchurch Press, 15 November, 1889)<br>
"Robert Watson was charged with assaulting his wife, Sarah Maria
Watson, on the 8th November. The complainant stated that they were
driving home from the Show on the date in question, and the defendant
called in at the Junction Hotel. Complainant told him not to be long,
as the cows had to be milked. She waited till near dark, when she sent
her little boy in for him, but he did not come, and she drove home. The
defendant arrived home shortly afterwards, and assaulted her by beating
and kicking her. Dr. Patrick gave evidence as to the nature of the
injuries the complainant had received. The injuries could not have been
caused by a fall from the trap. The defendant said he very likely
ill-used the woman, but he was too drunk to remember. He was annoyed by
her driving home without him. They had only been married three years.
The Bench strongly advised the defendant to give up drink, and warned
him that if he came up again on the same charge, he would be bound over
to keep the peace. He would be fined 20s and costs."</p>
<p>The little boy referred to is likely to be Sarah's youngest son Thomas, who would have been 6 years old at the time.</p>
