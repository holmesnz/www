<p><a href="pafg05.htm#111" name="111"><b>George McCURDY I</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>The McCurdy family which farmed near Clady, comprised four daughters and three sons. The eldest daughter, Catherine, died as an infant. The second daughter, Martha, married the Rev. W. McKinney who emigrated to New Zea1and, where his descendants still live.<br>
The third daughter, also Catherine, married the Rev. William Wray of Orritor, the son of Alexander Wray, merchant of Carnone. They had three sons and one daughter. The eldest son, William, went to Australia. The second son (Charles?) was a pharmacist at Cookstown, County Tyrone. The third son, Leeper, was resident in Winnipeg, Manitoba at the time of his death, which occurred 7 September 1950.<br>
The fourth McCurdy child, John (1835-1923) emigrated to Canada in 1870 and established a retail business "general merchant and postmaster" at Kirkton, Ontario. He remained there for the balance of his active life. He married Isobel Cooper, resident of that area. They had no children. It is obvious that he encouraged, and probably aided, various members of his younger sister's family to migrate to Canada as they reached the age of discretion. An interesting fact is that a decade before the arrival of McCurdy, Timothy Eaton had established his first Canadian store at Kirkton, which he left to set up business, first in St. Marys, and then in Toronto. John McCurdy was living with his niece, Elizabeth (Wray) Holmes at La Crosse, Wisconsin when he died on the 30th December 1923.<br>
Mary Elizabeth, who married W. J. A. Wray in 1859 was the fifth McCurdy child.<br>
Benjamin McCurdy ( -1877) was a staff surgeon with the Royal Navy. Tradition says that he died on shipboard while on the Red Sea. The saw fish bill which I inherited was a souvenir which he gave his brother-in-law, my grandfather.<br>
George McCurdy (1842-1927) married Jane Simms and had' a family of nine children. He lived near Rockfield, on the family farm which he inherited from his father. He is buried in Donoughniore Churchyard.</p>
