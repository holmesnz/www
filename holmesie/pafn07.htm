<blockquote><p>She lived with her younger brother on the family estate, which he had inherited on the death of his father. She never married. She was reputed to have held decided views on any matter under discussion, with a sharp tongue to back them up. The tradition is that it was due to her that no mention of this branch of the family was made in Mrs. Trench's book.<p>'Mrs Trench's book' possibly refers to "The Wrays of Donegal" by C.V. Trench, Oxford University Press, 1945</blockquote>
