<blockquote><p>Notes from Nick Holmes, 2013:<br>
It is rumoured he was disinherited for marrying a Catholic. This is
unconfirmed. His children had a lot more to do with their mother’s
side, the Burkes (she was the eldest of nine children). He did not go
to war, which was never forgotten by his brothers-in-laws, although
they themselves suffered long-lasting effects. He worked for the Public
Trust and also was a secretary of the National Party. He gets a mention
in the book that was written about the first 50 years of the party. He
attended Christchurch Boys’ High, which enabled some of his
grandchildren to attend in recent years. He and his wife Eileen also
ran a milk bar at one point. They were frugal, having seven children,
but being an office worker he did things like buy life insurance
policies for each of his children when they were born. He was also
known in later years to cook breakfast on a Saturday morning for
whomever was still left living at home. Dad tells a story about a time
when all the kids were conscripted to help paint the roof, and his Dad
saying, "Don't be afraid to <span style="font-style: italic;">put some on</span>."</p></blockquote>
