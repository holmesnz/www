<p>Notes from Nick Holmes, 2013:<br>
It is originally thought her maiden name was WELSH, as per her daughter
Sabina's death certificate. However Castlegar Church records show her
maiden name was HOGAN, with one of the bridesmaids at the wedding
having the surname WELSH/WALSH.<br>

UPDATE, 2018: Death cert indicates a maiden name of HOGAN and mother's
maiden name as WELCH. However parents' first names are at odds with the
christening record.</p>
