<p>Notes from Nick Holmes, 2018:<br>
Died very young and her children were split up and taken care of by family members.</p>
<p>Bruce Herald, Volume VI, Issue 412, 3 April 1872<br>
RESIDENT MAGISTRATE'S COURT. TOKOMAIRIRO.</p>
<p>Burke v. Mary Athy and Burke v. Margt. Athy — Charge of having
committed a violent assault. Defendants acknowledged having given Mrs
Burke "a beating" in consequence of provocation.<br>
Sobrina Frances Burke, sworn, stated — I know the defendants. I live at
Fairfax, my husband's name is Tom Burke. I was in my house about 8
o'clock in the morning. I had my child on my knee. Mrs Athy and her
daughter came into my house, and said that I had been telling lies on
her— I denied it — she then caught me by the hair of the head and
dragged me on to the floor, breaking the cups and saucers produced. I
produce the hair she tore out of my head. She struck me and knelt on
me, she and her daughter struck me repeatedly. My back and body show
marks as well as my face.<br>
The defendants were asked if they had any questions to ask.<br>
Mrs Athy — Why were you telling lies about me to Mrs Healey?<br>
Mrs Burke — I did not.<br>
The Magistrate — What were the lies.<br>
Mrs Athy— About "rotten butter," &amp;c. I wanted her to come and see
Mrs Healey. She would not come, but threatened to hit me, and I just
thumped her. Mrs Burke hit me with a stick, and my daughter did the
same to her.<br>
Dr Weber, examined — I saw complainant on Sabbath night — evidently she
had got a severe beating— but nothing dangerous in the results.<br>
Tobias Burke sworn — I met complainant shortly after the row took
place, and she told me about it. I went to Mrs Athy and said that it
was a shame how she had abused Mrs Burke. She threatened to do it again.<br>
The Magistrate said that under some fancied or real grievance the
defendants had, no doubt, made a very serious assault on Mrs Burke, and
beat her severely, so much hair had been torn out of her head that he
really did not know what the poor woman was to do for a chignon for the
next six months at least — she had been very severely handled. Fined
L3, and costs amounting to L3 9s.<br>
The excitability of the female partisans in court could, with very
great difficulty, be restrained, and the Magistrate was under the
necessity of threatening to clear the court and warned them that if
they came before him again, he would have to bind them over to keep the
peace.</p>
